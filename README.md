🍔🍎 Food Recognition & Calorie Estimation Using Deep Learning
This project implements a food recognition and calorie estimation system using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model can classify 101 different food categories and estimate their calorie content based on predefined average values.

📌 Features
✅ Train a CNN model on the Food-101 dataset 🍕🥗
✅ Perform real-time food classification using a deep learning model
✅ Estimate calorie content based on food category
✅ Use OpenCV for image processing and inference

🏗️ Project Workflow
1️⃣ Train the Model
Load and preprocess images from the Food-101 dataset
Train a ResNet50-based CNN for food classification
Save the trained model for inference
2️⃣ Food Recognition & Calorie Estimation
Load the pretrained model
Capture or input a food image
Predict the food category
Estimate calories based on predefined values
