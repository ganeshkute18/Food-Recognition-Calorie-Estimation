Project Overview
Food Recognition & Calorie Estimation using Deep Learning

This project aims to develop a deep learning model that can accurately identify food items from images and estimate their calorie content. The system will help users track their dietary intake, enabling healthier eating habits and informed food choices.

Objectives
Train a model to classify different food items from images.
Estimate the caloric content based on food type and portion size.
Provide an interactive interface for real-time food recognition.

Methodology
1️Dataset Collection & Preprocessing
Use publicly available datasets like:
Food-101 (101 food categories)
UEC-Food100 (Japanese food dataset)
IM2Calories (Food images with calorie info)
Resize images (e.g., 224x224 for CNN models).
Data Augmentation (Rotation, Scaling, Brightness adjustment).

2️Model Development
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for food classification.
Pretrained models (VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2) for transfer learning.
Regression model for estimating calorie content based on food type.

3️Feature Extraction & Training
Extract features using deep CNN layers.
Map food categories to caloric values based on nutritional databases.
Use bounding boxes to estimate portion sizes (optional).

4️Model Evaluation & Optimization
Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for improved accuracy.

5️Real-time Deployment
Deploy as a Flask/Streamlit web app.
Use OpenCV + Camera/Webcam for real-time food detection.
Allow users to upload images and receive food labels + calorie estimation.

Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras (CNN model training)
OpenCV (Image processing)
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Flask/Streamlit (Web app deployment)

Expected Outcomes
A food classification model with high accuracy.
Calorie estimation based on recognized food items.
A real-time food recognition system accessible via web or mobile.
